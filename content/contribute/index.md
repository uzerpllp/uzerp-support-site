There are many ways to contribute to uzERP... pull requests from developers are obviously welcome but improving documentation, filing bug reports or submitting a case study or use case would also be very much appreciated.

## Development

If you want to get involved in developing uzERP [The GitHub Repo](https://github.com/uzerpllp/uzerp) is a good place to start

We've set up a containerized development version of uzERP to get you up and running quickly without having to spin up a virtual machine or install on a hosting provider - go [here](/articles/development-cli/) for more information.

There is a [developer's page](/articles/technical/) that will be updated regularly and can serve as a jumping off point for more information plus technical articles will be posted on this site under [Articles](/articles) on the top menu.

## Create an issue

* Bug report - raise an [issue on github](https://github.com/uzerpllp/uzerp/issues/new)
* Feature request - The [ideas](https://github.com/uzerpllp/uzerp/discussions/categories/ideas) section on the discussion forum is a good place to start.

## Improve the documentation

The repo for this documentation is [here](https://github.com/uzerpllp/uzerp-support-site) - if you think something is wrong please create an issue and we'll put it right.

## Submit a case study or blog post

We'd love to hear about your use of uzERP so do [get in touch](https://uzerp.com/contact) and share what youâ€™ve built with us!
