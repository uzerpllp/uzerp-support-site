There is a check box to set the preference for the auto creation of account numbers. Use this if you want system generated account numbers - if maintaining a link with legacy data it may be wise to enter historic, manual, account codes.

## Contact Categories

Categories can be associated with a either Companies or People, or both. The following have some impact on how the system works

* Employee - if a person within the system company is marked as an employee then they will be available in the HR system

* Customer - an account marked as a customer will be available in the [Sales Ledger](sales_ledger) (AR) system

* Supplier - an account marked as a supplier will be available in the [Purchase Ledger](purchase_ledger) (AP) system

If you use the 'starter' instance then Contact categories already has 'Employee', 'Customer' and 'Supplier' set up.

## Other Information

Apart from the above there is little setup required in the contacts module beyond the optional classifications you require. The different sections you can use are:

* Company Classifications

* Company Industries

* Company Ratings

* Company Sources

* Company Statuses

* Company Types
