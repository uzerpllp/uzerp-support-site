## How do I...?

### Show the outstanding invoices for a customer?

Go to the sales ledger record and click the side bar action 'Outstanding' under Related Items.

### Find out when a customer has paid and which invoices payment covered?

Under the customer's account in sales ledger and look at the 'All Invoices' side bar link - if its paid you can click on 'paid' to see the cross reference transactions and therefore the payment. If the payment is unallocated use the 'Outstanding' link to find the payment.

### Put a customer on stop?

Go to the customer under Sales ledger and look for the side bar action 'Stop Account'

### Refund a customer in credit?

 1. Enter refund into cashbook as a cashbook payment (VAT = none) - GL code as appropriate
 2. Enter SL journal for same amount to same GL code
 3. Allocate SL journal to SL credit(s)
