## How do I...?

### Add an Item for sale

To add stocks you go to the menu option Manufacturing->Stock Items->Add a stock item OR Manufacturing->Stock Items and then 'add' from the sidebar. This adds the 'internal' stock information for stores and manufacturing purposes. To get them into sales orders then you need to add external information (i.e. price) which then looks at SO Product lines. Go here Logistics->Sales Orders->Products

Note that an SO product doesn't necessarily have to be on stock.

### Find out how much of an item I have sold?

When viewing the details for an item click the sidebar action 'Show Sales Invoices'.

### Find out what stock is at a particular location

Use menu option Manufacturing -> Stores, click the store you are interested in and then the location - then use the sidebar action 'Show Stock Balances'.
