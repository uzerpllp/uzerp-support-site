## How do I....?

### Convert a Lead into an Account?

Use the sidebar option 'Convert To Account' when viewing the Lead - this will require the entry of an account number. Once converted the Sales or Purchase Ledger details can be set up by going to the appropriate main menu option:

* Accounts -> Purchase Ledger -> View Suppliers -> Add Supplier
* Accounts -> Sales Ledger -> Customers -> Add Customers

### Find People related to a particular customer?

Use the main menu option: Accounts -> People

Use the search option by company and and click the **Search** button. This list can be printed, emailed or exported by clicking on the **Output** button.
