## How do I...?

### Carry out a cheque or BACS run?

See [[Batch Payments|Modules/Accounts/Batch-Payments]]

### Set up Periodic or Recurring payments

Go to Setup -> Ledger Setup -> Periodic Payments - from here you can set up payments AND receipts. There is an uzLET within the cashbook module to show overdue periodic payments.
