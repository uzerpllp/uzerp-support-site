## How Do I...?

### Export data to spreadsheet?

The steps are quite simple:

 1. On any view or report click the output button
 2. Select 'CSV' as the File Type and View as the Action
 3. Set the options as approriate
 4. Click Output Document

Depending on your setup the browser will either download the file or open it in the appropriate client application.
