The Leads section of the [[Contacts|User Manual/Modules/Contacts]] module stores information about sales prospects for use in the [[CRM]] process.

When a lead turns from being a prospective customer into a live account it can be converted using the convert to account option - it will then be available in the [[Accounts]] section of the [[Contacts]] module and can be allocated as a customer in the [[Sales Ledger]].
