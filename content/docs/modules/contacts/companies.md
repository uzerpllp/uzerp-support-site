The Companies section under [[Contacts]] stores information on business partners that you already deal with.

In order to tag an account for use in the [[Sales Ledger]] or [Purchase Ledger](purchase_ledger) the category must be set to Customer or Supplier. An account can be either or both meaning that a single source of contact information is kept for all trading partners.
