The uzERP Sales Ledger allows you to create and maintain information about your customers. Invoices are entered in the [Sales Invoice Register](Sales Invoice Register) system when you sell goods and services and cash receipts and other credit transactions can be allocated against the invoices.

The Sales Ledger is an open item system which means that the invoices remain outstanding until they are removed by having credit items (cash, Credit Notes) allocated to them. Postings are made to the General Ledger and the Tax system automatically.

Tips and tricks for Sales Ledger are [here](slhowto).
