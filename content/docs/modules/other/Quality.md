The quality module allows users to input and track complaints by retailer, status,  complaint type, product etc.

## Adding / Editing a Complaint

The only required field for a complaint is the date of which it is raised, which can be any time in the past, present or future. However entering an as concise complaint will increase it's value to you as data.

## Complaint Behaviour

When entering a complaint, certain fields values can affect the behaviour of other fields, and thus, general functionality. You should be aware of the following:

### Entering a completed date will remove the assigned to person

The assigned to field is great for being able to track a complaint as it circulates your organisation, however when a complaint has been closed a completed date should be entered. When a complaint is completed it is no longer one person's responsibility, therefore any value within the assigned to field is removed.
