## One-Click install

The quickest way to get up and running with a full uzERP install is to use the [Digital Ocean Marketplace](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/) app.

If you already have a Digital Ocean account uzERP can be deployed with one-click onto the lowest tier for $5 per month.

See the [uzERP application page](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/uzerp) on Digital Ocean for more information.

## Credentials

Once the droplet is deployed you can log into the starter instance with the username/password 'admin'.

## Next steps

You probably should secure uzERP so you connect using encrypted HTTPS traffic, the simplest way is to use a DigitalOcean load balancer and install a LetsEncrypt certificate.

From there go to the [Initial Setup page](/docs/setup/initial-setup/) to get started testing uzERP.
